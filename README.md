# Puius Audio Player
Puius Audio Player is simply a program which can be used to play all sorts of audio files, as long as they're supported by SDL_mixer. The project started as a way to improve my C programming skill and also as a way to learn how to use microui. A lot of the design choices were made with the idea of using malloc() as little as possible.

# Building
**Linux:**
You must have installed SDL3 and SDL3_mixer. The header files are included from `include/SDL3/` and `include/SDL3_mixer/` respectively.
